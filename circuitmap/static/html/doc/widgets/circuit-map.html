    <h3>Circuit Map</h3>

    <p>Circuit Map can operate in two modes: it can fetch a) all synapses for
    the currently selected skeleton and b) fetch a segmentation based skeleton
    for a given location along with the synapses linked to it. For both modes,
    existing synapses in the target project are used if they are available and
    match the automatically generated synapse.</p>

    <p>Additionally, both modes allow to also fetch the respective partner
    fragments for each synapse that is available from the segmentation data.
    Both modes are described in more detail below.</p>

    <h4>Fetching synapses for a particular neuron</h4>

    <p>To find all synapses for a particular skeleton/neuron, the respective
    skeleton has to be selected first in CATMAID. A straight-forward way to find
    neurons is by opening the <em>Neuron Navigator</em>:</p>

    <p><ol>
      <li>Either click the compass icon in the toolbar or search for "Navigator" in the
        <em>Open Widget</em> dialog (see above).</li>
      <li>Double-click on "All neurons" and double-click a neuron that you want
        to add synapses too.</li>
      <li>Click on <kbd>Go to nearest node</kbd> to select the skeleton.</li>

    </ol></p>

    <p>With a skeleton selected, go back to the <em>Circuit Map</em> widget and press
    the <kbd>Fetch synapses for active neuron</kbd>. This will queue an
    asynchronous task on the server which will fetch all synapses for the active
    skeletons. Depending on the setup of the CATMAID instance, the front-end
    will refresh automatically, once the data is ready (if WebSockets/ASGI
    is enabled). Alternatively the current view can be reloaded by clicking on
    the <em>Tracing Tool</em> icon.</p>

    <h4>Fetching the segmentation fragment at a location plus its synapses</h4>

    <p>If no existing neuron is already present at a location of interest,
    Circuit Map can be used to fetch a segmentation based skeleton fragment
    along with synapses connected to it. The widget will use the center of the
    field of view in the active stack viewer as query location. This can be
    easier to see by enabling reference lines that cross at the center of the
    view. This can be done by</p>

    <p><ol>
      <li>Opening the <em>Settings Widget</em> by clicking on the gear icon in
        the top toolbar.</li>
      <li>Find the "Display reference lines" option in the "Stack view" section
        and enable.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p> When ready, press <kbd>Fetch autoseg skeleton and synapses at
    location</kbd> in the <em>Circuit Map widget</em>. This will kick off a
    background task on the server that fetches the closest segmentation fragment
    along with its synapses. Typically, this process takes not longer than a
    few seconds. After a refresh (either automatically if set up or manually by
    reloading the <em>Tracing Tool</em>, the new skeleton should appear and can
    be used like any other skeleton.</p>

    <h4>Fetching partner fragments</h4>

    <p>In CATMAID synapses consist of a <em>presynaptic connection</em> from a
    presynaptic node in a skeleton to a <em>connector node</em> as well as one
    or more <em>postsynaptic connections</em> from the connector node to
    postynaptic nodes in partner skeletons.</p>

    <p>By default <em>Circuit Map</em> will only fetch one half of these synapses: the
    connections linked to either a) the active skeleton or b) the segmentation
    fragment at a particular location. It is however possible to also fetch
    partner fragments for automatically fetched synapses. This can be enabled
    using the two checkboxes in the configuration section of the <em>Circuit Map
    widget</em>. The option "Fetch upstream autoseg skeletons" will fetch all
    fragments presynaptic to the query skeleton/fragment and the "Fetch
    downstream autoseg skeletons" option will consider all segmentation
    fragments postsynaptic to the query skeleton/fragment. In both cases, to be
    actually added, the number of connections between the fragments and the
    query skeleton/fragment needs to be at least as large as defined in the two
    threshold input fields in the widget.</p>

    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>It might be useful to monitor the number of synapses as well as the
          visual representation befor and after synapses are added. To so, open
          the <em>3D Viewer</em> and add the active skeletonto the <em>Selection
          Table</em> that was opened alongside the 3D Viewer (right below it)
          by selection "Active skeleton" as <em>From</em> and then click the
          <kbd>Append</kbd> button. Synapses are displayed by default. To get
          basic synapse counts, click on <kbd>Measure</kbd> in the <em>Selection
          Table</em>. While both the <em>3D Viewer</em> and the <em>Measurement
          Table</em> can be refreshed with the help of the <kbd>Refresh</kbd>
          button, it might be useful to open just a second instance of both
          widgets, so the before and after can be seen more easily. <em>Note:</em>
          Windows can be moved around in CATMAID by dragging the window title bar
          with the mouse.</li>
        <li>Undo is not possible at this point. Past data can however normally
          be recovered in CATMAID thanks to a complete audit log. In production
          environments it is however advisable regardless to make sure synapses
          are added to the correct skeleton.</li>
      </ul>
